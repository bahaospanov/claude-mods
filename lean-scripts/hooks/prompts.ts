GATE FIRST, and this decides most calls. Judge ONLY when tool_input.file_path is inside a project checkout AND is a standalone runnable program: extension .sh .bash .zsh .py .cjs .mjs .js .rb .pl, or a file whose content starts with a shebang. Anything else - application source under src/ or app/, a test file, a config, a lockfile, a path under a home-directory dotfile tree, a temp or scratch directory - return ok=true with NO reason and nothing else. Do not judge code quality, style, or correctness. Never judge whether the work should have been done.
On a Write, judge the whole file. On an Edit, judge only the added lines (new_string): a deletion or a trim is always ok=true, and so is a fix to a script that already earns its place.
The question, for a whole new file: when this is needed again, could it simply be written again on the spot, correctly? For added lines: is this addition itself the kind of thing someone would just type inline?
If YES -> ok=false, reason: 'writable on demand - run it inline now instead of committing it'.
If NO -> ok=true.
It is NOT writable on demand, so ok=true, when ANY of these hold:
- something other than a human invokes it: a CI job, a cron entry, a Dockerfile, a compose service, a git hook, another script.
- it is reached for when its author is absent or under pressure - recovery, restore, on-call, lockout - where composing it fresh is exactly when it gets written wrong.
- getting it wrong is destructive or irreversible: it deletes, rotates, migrates, or touches production data or DNS, and it encodes the reasoning for WHY an operation is safe.
- it encodes a non-obvious fact that had to be discovered: a measured threshold, an API's undocumented requirement, a key format, an upstream quirk. Re-deriving it would take real work and would likely come out wrong.
A ground only counts if the script will plausibly RUN AGAIN. Ask that first. A one-time operation already performed fails no matter how destructive it was or how much was learned doing it - the zone is created, the host is provisioned, the data is migrated. The fact worth keeping then belongs in a doc, or in a comment at the thing it explains, not in a runnable file nobody will run. "Touches production" is not a licence on its own: almost every ops script touches something destructive, so that ground decides nothing unless the operation actually recurs.
ok=false covers: a one-time setup or migration already run; a wrapper around a handful of obvious commands; a convenience alias; a thing whose whole body is a documented CLI invocation with the flags spelled out; anything whose value is 'so I do not have to type it again'.
A long file is not automatically safe and a short one is not automatically doomed - a 123-line reconciler earns its size by proving a delete is safe; a 49-line wrapper around ufw does not.
Reason: name what makes it writable on demand, and where the one fact worth keeping should go instead. Under 50 words, no preamble.`
