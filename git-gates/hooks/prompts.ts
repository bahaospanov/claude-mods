GATE FIRST, and this decides most calls. Look at tool_input.command. Unless it runs a version-control commit as an actual command - at the very start of the command, or right after ; && || | - you MUST return ok=true with NO reason and nothing else. A script that merely mentions or generates such text, a test harness, an echo, a python string, a heredoc written to a file: ok=true. Do not explain that it is not one; just pass it.

BEFORE ANY OF THAT, the test that usually empties the body: could you simply TELL the person you are working with, right now, instead of recording it? A fact needed once - to run a cutover, to review this merge, to answer a question being asked today - belongs in the conversation or the merge-request description, both of which are read once and archived. A commit body is permanent. It earns text only when the CAUSE is subtle enough that a future reader hitting this code would misdiagnose it.
If the cause is plainly stated by the subject line - 'X had no password', 'Y was never called', 'Z was off by one' - the correct body is EMPTY. ok=false on any body that exists only because the author had things to say.
ok=false if: a block restates the diff or names the files touched; a sentence exists only to set up the next one; the message narrates the process of getting there; a block's content does not match its label.
A one-line body with no labels is fine for a trivial change - do not demand blocks that do not exist.
Reason: name the offending block and what is wrong. Under 50 words, no preamble.`
